# Yvonne Weldon comments on cycling

We need to protect and build upon our  
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.640]   existing transport infrastructure. The opening of the new Metro is a milestone  
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:18.240]   and it will be great for our city in this area but more for a better active  
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.600]   transport infrastructure too. We need to continue to improve the walkability and  
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:29.960]   accessibility for our streets for all. I've joined the chorus of voices pushing  
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.960]   for a footbridge connecting North and South Everleigh. The state government  
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.880]   needs to make this happen and if they won't council might need to bite the  
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.360]   bullet and chip in some funds to bring them to the table and to see this happen.  
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.640]   Bad cycleway policy is driving Sydney. When done right like on Bourke Street in  
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.120]   Redfern and Wilson Street in Darlington it's great but the pop-up cycleways on  
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.720]   Henderson Street in Erskineville, Ridge Road in Glebe and Moor Park Road are  
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.120]   disastrous. They were installed overnight with no consultation, poorly constructed,  
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:13.000]   unsafe and underutilised.

# Lyndon Gannon comments on cycling
In terms of transport, pretty clear we have a current  
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:44.800]   administration that seems to squarely focus cyclists. Now I'm all for cycling  
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.920]   infrastructure. I cycle daily and I ride a motorcycle but the interests of  
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.720]   all road users and users of our public spaces need to be taken into  
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.800]   consideration. We only have to look at the Zalaska of the COVID era pop-up  
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.200]   cycleways. They're not fit for purpose and they need a lot of work to make them  
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.680]   right which I'm committed to doing. The Oxford Street cycleway is another big  
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:13.000]   issue. The current designs just aren't right. Locals have major concerns with  
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.880]   them which I share. If elected I'll work closely with Transport for New South  
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.680]   Wales to make sure that these pieces of infrastructure work for all of those who  
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.320]   use our streets, not just cyclists.

# Clover Moore comments on cycling

You've identified three important issues and I'll start  
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.600]   with transport, finding a balance. I want to start by saying that action on  
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.200]   climate change is a top priority for the city and transport is the second  
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.240]   highest and fastest growing source of CO2, which pre-COVID generated 20% of  
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.840]   emissions. Our commitment to light rail, to cycle ways and creating a city for  
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:26.520]   walking reduces emissions, provides clean and efficient alternatives to driving  
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:33.920]   and improves productivity and people's health. And communities have told us that  
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.520]   they want a city that is safe for walking and cycling, with better public  
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.920]   transport. A city for people rather than cars. We are spending 28 million dollars  
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.000]   a year on walking related improvements, especially as 93% of all trips involve  
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.080]   walking. If a car hits a pedestrian at 50 kilometres an hour there is just a 10%  
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:58.000]   chance of survival. That chance goes up to 60% of the cars travelling at 40  
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.960]   kilometres an hour and goes up to 90% if the car is travelling at 30  
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:07.720]   kilometres an hour. And the good news is that 75% of city controlled streets now  
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.840]   have speed limits of 40 kilometres and soon they will include all city  
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.200]   controlled streets. We're also advocating to government for 30 kilometre an hour  
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   in our village centres and in the CBD. When I became Lord Mayor the city had no  
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.840]   separated cycleways. Now we have 25 kilometres of safe separated cycleways  
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.960]   and more than 10,000 people safely ride to work in the city centre each day, the  
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:39.680]   equivalent of 10 full trains and 166 full buses. 70% of Sydney-siders  
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.860]   told us that they would feel safer riding if there were more separated  
[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:48.360]   cycleways. But not everyone can ride or walk so enabling people to ride and walk  
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.340]   and use public transport frees up congested roads for people who need to  
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:57.040]   drive, that is our trades people and people with a disability. And cost of  
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.740]   living is a great challenge and cycling isn't affordable for those that can  
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.320]   cycle. And to mitigate the impacts from WestConnex in Alexandria and Erskineville  
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.440]   the city has committed to 6.5 million dollars for 17 traffic management  
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.740]   treatments over the next term following our consultations with you. And recently  
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.760]   we opened stage one of the Green Square to Ashmore connector. I'm very excited  
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.680]   about this, it's a cycling, walking and public transport street that will enable  
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.880]   the people from Ashmore and Erskineville to easily get to community facilities in  
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   Green Square and Green Square residents to easily get to beautiful Sydney Park.  
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.160]   We'll be doing in stage two at the beginning of next year. I'll continue to  
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.720]   call on the government to build the active transport bridge between North  
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:45.120]   and South Everleigh which is long overdue.

# Sue Ritchie comments on cycling

Look on the issue of  
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:58.800]   transport here, finding a balance, look we are saying that after all this time  
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:05.040]   after 20 years with bike paths, cycle ways there needs to be a review and an  
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:10.520]   audit and again if we don't have change at the top that is not going to happen.  
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.760]   We'll just continue with what's been happening whereas the change will ensure  
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:19.400]   that there's a review, there's an audit. Certainly if I become mayor some of these  
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:26.000]   bike lanes, some of them will have to go. For example in the city of  
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.920]   Sydney, I mean Pitt Street now has become a parking lot really and so that's  
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:38.080]   probably one of the first ones to go. However look we're not saying no bike  
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:47.200]   lanes but certainly we need a review and a balance between the bike lanes,  
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:59.400]   pedestrians and vehicles.

# Zann Maxwell

(no mention supporting or rejecting cycleways)

# Sylvie Ellsmore
Finally just briefly on transport which is the last one the  
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.880]   Greens are very proud of very proud champions of active transport. Lower  
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:36.080]   speed limits on our streets, wider footpaths, dramatically reducing  
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:41.120]   dependence on cars.

# Rachel Evans

So public  
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:26.160]   transport. Sydney could be a green transport city. Instead we are surrounded  
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.800]   and dominated by toll roads and cranky car drivers finding it hard to park.  
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.840]   These drivers are also stressed residents paying extraordinary housing  
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.920]   costs. Sydney is the second most expensive place to live in the world.  
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:47.080]   This is a city led by corporate logic so reorientating transport is critical  
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:52.240]   because to stop climate collapse we need to drastically reduce carbon  
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:57.880]   emissions and 1/4 25% of carbon is emitted by the private transport sector.  
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:04.440]   Former NASA climate scientist James Hansen said by mid this year the 1.5  
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:10.400]   degrees Celsius warming ceiling will be passed for all practicable purposes.  
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:15.520]   Beyond 1.5 degree warming it is likely that four major earth system elements  
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:20.400]   the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheet, the tropical coral reefs and the  
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:25.000]   boreal thermal frost will start collapsing even if we cut emissions  
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.200]   rapidly. So we have to do everything to put the brakes on carbon emission and  
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:36.560]   free mass clean fun social public transport must be part of that plan.  
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:41.080]   We want land West Connex stole from the community for an interconnected active  
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:46.440]   public transport system with bike paths and walkways electric buses trains trams  
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:53.040]   plus traffic calming and walkway bridges. Like in Mexico City and Paris Socialist  
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:58.000]   Alliance wants Sydney Council to provide a car-free day for the city once a week.  
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.520]   Friends on the question of development cities that run on capitalist logic  
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:08.040]   privatized spaces meaning people can't gather for free. Public spaces get  
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.920]   sidelined and services are privatized. Corporations don't deliver services for  
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.360]   the good of communities and environments they operate for profit. We join the  
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:23.640]   growing chorus demanding Council end outsourcing and bring services back in  
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:28.480]   house. Garbage collection, bike path building, light bulb changing for example. 

# Sean Masters
The first one being  
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:37.200]   transport. Now obviously state government and local government need to work hand  
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:44.920]   in hand when it comes to suitable and appropriate public transport for  
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:52.200]   residents. But my biggest concern when it comes to transport and the shared bike  
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:57.600]   lanes pedestrians and cars public transport my biggest concern as opposed  
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:05.160]   to my my fellow candidate the previous speaker my concern is bike lanes as that  
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:13.920]   pertains to cars. Now for me and to some extent Sue without putting words in her  
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:21.560]   mouth I say I want to put a freeze on bike lanes I say no more bike lanes M  
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:29.040]   double O R E if you can commit the wordplay there clover. Now look it seems  
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:33.680]   to me that you know I'm sure there is an overarching plan but it feels to  
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.520]   residents that I've been speaking to that it's almost like there is no  
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.600]   holistic plan for bike lanes and it's almost like they decided by throwing a  
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:50.560]   dart at a map they lead to nowhere they they lead to congestion in many areas as  
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.360]   a previous speaker mentioned in the city and they lead to less parking for  
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:01.280]   residents. Now in our drive to net zero everyone seems to have forgotten that  
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.160]   people still drive cars. People need to get around people need to get to work  
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.520]   people need to pick up the kids and when they get home they need somewhere to  
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:18.440]   park. So I come down firmly when it comes to transport on the needs of motorists  
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:24.600]   and I accept that I am not amongst friends here but I do need to make my  
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:32.720]   make my point known. Please don't throw fruit or shoes or any other or any more  
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:39.160]   darts for that matter.
